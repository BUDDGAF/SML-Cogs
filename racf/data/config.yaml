    You may have been kicked for having a poor win percentage on collection day or war day.
    We take war very seriously and provide tools to help with deck creation.
    We encourage members to practice with each other and collaborate before attacking.


    If you decide to join a lower feeder please consider using the tools we have
    to increase your war success and remain in the 100T clan family.


    If clan wars is not your cup of tea, you may wish to join 100T Zen.
    Please use the passphrase “Life is a journey” when requesting.


    Our clans are Alpha / Bravo / Charlie / Delta /
    Echo / Foxtrot / Golf / Hotel / Zen with the red rocket emblem.
    Good luck on the ladder + the next war!
  k5alpha: >
    You have been kicked due to your card levels not being up to our expectancy.
    In Alpha, we require new members to have at least all Epics at level 7
    due to our high ranking in the Clan Wars Leaderboard.


    If you decide to join a lower feeder our clans are 100T Alpha / 100T Bravo /
    100T Charlie / 100T Delta / 100T Echo / 100T Foxtrot / 100T Golf / 100T Hotel /
    100T Zen with the red rocket emblem.


    Good luck on the ladder + the next war!"

    Sorry, but you were 50/50 and we have
    kicked you from the Brawl Stars band.
    Please join one of our feeders for now.
    Our clans are Alpha / Bravo / Charlie
    with the red skull emblem.
    Good luck in your future games!

    Welcome to the glorious role of Elder.
    Your name is now blue on discord.
    That’s all this means. Don’t touch a damn thing. We’re serious.


    Please consult http://docs.redditalpha.com/#/racf/roles
    to learn what to do, and if you eventually rise to the role of Co-Leader
    where we care about you because you’re doing important things.

    Thank you for your interest in joining 100 Thieves.
    Unfortunately, your request to join our clan family wasn’t approved at this time.
    This is generally due to low war wins and/or low card levels.


    Most of our clans require anywhere from 30-50% of your cards to be upgraded to
    gold league standard levels (tournament standard +2) — we call this your “gold readiness percentage”.
    You can check your ”gold readiness’ at any time by viewing your profile on https://www.royaleapi.com/.


    Please feel free to hang around in our <#277425134862860288> channel and connect with us later
    after you’ve had a chance to upgrade your cards and/or improve your war wins.
