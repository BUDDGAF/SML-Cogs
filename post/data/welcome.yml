    description: >
      The RoyaleAPI Clan Family was originally known as the Reddit Alpha Clan Family and then briefly as the 100 Thieves Clan Family. Home to professional players that eventually moved on to play at CRNAO, King’s Cup, and CRL, our family fosters an environment where casual and competitive styles of play can both flourish.


      Our clan family boasts a top 25 global flagship clan and a system of feeder clans where we help our players learn, grow, and enhance their skills through a highly active & supportive Discord server.
